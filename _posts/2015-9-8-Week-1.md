Hello, world! This is my very first blog entry for CS 371P: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) taught by Professor, Glenn Downing.

First order of business, due to out-of-the-classroom issues and responsibilities, I am writing this Week 1 post in the middle of week 3. I don't expect Professor Downing to have any mercy on me. However, I have decided to still attempt this blog just for the and experience with Github Pages and Jekyll (which I'm not entirely sure I'm pronouncing it correctly). I may not get credit but I will have new knowledge of these cool new tools.
