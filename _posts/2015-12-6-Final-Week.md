title: Final Week

In the final week of OOP, Dr. Downing finished showing us how we can implement Reflection in C++, appose to Java already having the feature built in. We also went over three different handler classes. Handlers are useful because even though you can't create an abstract class instance, you can create a hadler that can be instanciated and allows for Abstract pointers be created so one can be able to pivot from one child to another from the same spot. Memory leaks are very well taken care of.

This period also consisted of studying for the second midterm of the class. The last project, Life, has taken quite a while to be graded. The only issue I have with this is that it's already past our last day of class and for many of us, what ever grade we get on the last project and this midterm will determine everything.

As for me, I felt like I did a very thorough job studying and preparing for the exam. There was nothing that was taught in the class that I didn't understand. Once I finished studying I had a great grasp over everything taught to us, including the material we went over in the first half of the course. However, come exam time, there were a couple of questions that really through me off balance. Obviously without getting into the details of the questions I was asked, I didn't feel like I could have prepared any differently and still understood what was being asked of me on the exam.

So after walking out of the exam feeling this way, not knowing what I grade I've earned on the last project, and not doing well on one of the 5 projects has really had me worried and depressed. Just thinking about getting a failing grade after having a very good underrstanding and having the decency to apply the material has put me down.

Thinking of ways to apply material not explicitly taught in the class is the best way to study. For studens incoming to take this course, my advice would be that exact thing. It's what I did, but I didn't question enough in what other ways it could be applied. So just think of the bizzarest implementations and the power of each feature taught in the class.

The class itself was amazing. Coming from a background of just Java and Python, learning a language like C++ really teaching you so much of how everything is handled under the hood. Not just for C++ but for languages like Java and Python. You connect the dots together and it's a great feeling. If/when the time comes that I will program in Java or Python or any other language, I feel like my programming skills are just way sharper just because of the ability to compare to a lower level language like C++.
