title: Week 2
---

Once again, I'm writing this blog entry for week 2 in the middle of week 3. Due to overcommitments, I wasn't able to start this blogging process until now. Again, I don't expect any credit for it, but I'm still doing it for the experience. I find this to be pretty fun and relaxing! Keeping track on how we feel on a weekly basis can be great for reflection. Also, reading other's blog entries and seeing how they feel can help someone like me, who is always feeling like I'm the lost one.

Week 2 was all about Collatz and very minimal C++, which I'm happy about. With my experience with C, C++ scares me, which is why I delayed taking this course until now, when I felt I was ready to take on the challenge. But Professor Downing spent a lot of time making sure we understood the specs of Collatz. I think this is only because it's the first programming assingment of the course, and the main purpose is to get us familiar with GitHub, Sphere, Travis CI, and testing. Since we'll be more familiar with these tools, I think Professor Downing won't be as nice and helpful for the programming assingments that follow Collatz.
